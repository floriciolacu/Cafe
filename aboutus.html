<main>
	<p> Our cafe is unique in our country. The concept of "A hug in a cup" started when we observed how much a cup of coffee or tea can help. <br>
	As our motto says, "No depresso. Positivitea.", we want to offer people that happiness of tasting a good drink, that gets you started to a better day, with more energy and good feeling.

		<h4 id = "first"> <time datetime="2016-04-07"> 7.04.2016 </time> <br> First day </h4>
		<p> The first day was the hardest of the all. We just opened up and we didn't know what will happen, if people will come or no. <br>
		Before we opened, we tried to make ourselves known, but we still didn't know what to expect. <br>
		First clients were our friends who were supporting us. Then it was silence. <br>
		After a while, people started to show up. Not so many, but it was great for us seeing that.
		</p>

	<article>
		<h4 id = "increased"> How we increased </h4>
		<p> People were coming, but not so many and the bussiness didn't go as well as we expected. <br>
		We were quite disappointed, but we couldn't give up on our dream. So we started to promote our cafe even more using social media, flyers, giving special offers to people. <br>
		This way, we managed to grow our cafe and get more clients.
		</p>

	<article>
		<h4 id = "now"> Now </h4>
		<p> Now our bussiness is growing day by day and we are very happy and proud. <br>
		We want to offer our clients best drinks and for them to leave happy and come again. <br>
		We also plan on opening more coffee shops in many locations.
